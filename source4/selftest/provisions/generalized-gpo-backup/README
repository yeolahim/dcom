This backup was created by running:

1. samba-tool gpo backup {2F840485-D0DE-4201-A1AB-F49557E52C15} --generalize /tmp/entities

   With a GPO built from Windows GPO editor, export it out.

2. Editing /tmp/entities to replace any domain information

   Remove the domain specific file shares from the entity files.

3. samba-tool gpo restore backup_for_test /tmp/policy/{2F840485-D0DE-4201-A1AB-F49557E52C15} --entities /tmp/entities

   We do the restore and backup again so that binary inconsistencies can be ironed out.

   This is quite clearly the case with the Registry.pol file where Windows cannot seem to decide how to null-terminated strings.

4. samba-tool gpo backup {1E1DC8EA-390C-4800-B327-98B56A0AEA5D} --generalize

   Export the GPO again in a more canonicalized form.
