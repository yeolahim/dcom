	<para>
	  This parameter controls the maximum size of extended attributes
	  that may be written to the server as EAs or as alternate data
	  streams if vfs_streams_xattr is enabled. The maximum size of
	  extended attributes depends on the Samba server's operating system
	  and the underlying filesystem. The Linux VFS currently sets an
	  upper boundary of 64 KiB per extended attribute. FreeBSD does not
	  set a practical upper limit, but since pread() and pwrite() are not
	  possible via the extattr on FreeBSD, it is not recommended to
	  increase this value above a few MiB.

	  If a client attempts to write an overly-large alternate datastream,
	  the Samba server will return STATUS_FILESYSTEM_LIMITATION.
	  If this error is encountered, users may try increasing the maximum
	  size supported for xattr writes. If this is not possible, and
	  writes are from a MacOS client and to an AFP_Resource extended
	  attribute, the user may enable the vfs_fruit module and configure
	  to allow stream writes for AFP_Resource to an alternative storage
	  location. See vfs_fruit documentation for further details.
