<description>
	<para>This option controls the way Samba handles client requests setting
	the Security Descriptor of files and directories and the effect the
	operation has on the Security Descriptor flag &quot;DACL
	auto-inherited&quot; (DI). Generally, this flag is set on a file (or
	directory) upon creation if the parent directory has DI set and also has
	inheritable ACEs.
	</para>

	<para>On the other hand when a Security Descriptor is explicitly set on
	a file, the DI flag is cleared, unless the flag &quot;DACL Inheritance
	Required&quot; (DR) is also set in the new Security Descriptor (fwiw, DR is
	never stored on disk).</para>

	<para>This is the default behaviour when this option is enabled (the
	default). When setting this option to <command>no</command>, the
	resulting value of the DI flag on-disk is directly taken from the DI
	value of the to-be-set Security Descriptor. This can be used so dump
	tools like rsync that copy data blobs from xattrs that represent ACLs
	created by the acl_xattr VFS module will result in copies of the ACL
	that are identical to the source. Without this option, the copied ACLs
	would all loose the DI flag if set on the source.</para>
