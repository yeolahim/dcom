	<para>When enabled, this option causes Samba (acting as an
	Active Directory Domain Controller) to stream authentication
	events across the internal message bus.  Scripts built using
	Samba's python bindings can listen to these events by
	registering as the service
	<filename moreinfo="none">auth_event</filename>.</para>

	<para>This is <emphasis>not</emphasis> needed for the audit
	logging described in <smbconfoption name="log level"/>.</para>

	<para>Instead, this should instead be considered a developer
	option (it assists in the Samba testsuite) rather than a
	facility for external auditing, as message delivery is not
	guaranteed (a feature that the testsuite works around).</para>

	<para>The authentication events are also logged via the normal
	logging methods when the <smbconfoption name="log level"/> is
	set appropriately, say to
	<command moreinfo="none">auth_json_audit:3</command>.</para>
